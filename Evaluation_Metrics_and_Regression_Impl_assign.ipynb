        "\n",
        "**Ans:**  In a regression model, R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s). It's a statistical measure that indicates how well a model fits the data, with a higher R-squared value suggesting a better fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it measures:**\n",
        "R-squared quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It essentially tells you how much of the variation in your predicted values matches the actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to interpret it:**\n",
        "An R-squared of 1 (or 100%) means the model perfectly explains all the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "An R-squared of 0 means the model explains none of the variation.\n",
        "Values between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%) indicate the proportion of variance explained. For example, an R-squared of 0.75 means 75% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Linearity:\n",

It measures the average of the squares of the differences between the predicted values and the actual values.

This suggests a strong and robust fit, where the model effectively captures the underlying relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",

By focusing on the key variables, feature selection can enhance the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability to unseen data.\n",
