        "\n",
        "**ans:** What is it?\n",
        "\n",
        "WiredTiger is the default storage engine in MongoDB since version 3.2.\n",
        "\n",
        "A storage engine is the component that manages how data is stored, compressed, and retrieved from disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before WiredTiger, MongoDB used the MMAPv1 storage engine, which was less efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Why is WiredTiger important?\n",
        "\n",
        "Document-Level Concurrency\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike MMAPv1 (which locked entire collections), WiredTiger supports document-level locking.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means multiple operations can happen simultaneously on different documents → better performance for high-concurrency applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compression for Efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        "WiredTiger supports snappy and zlib compression.\n",
        "\n",
        "This reduces disk space usage and improves read/write efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "High Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster read/write throughput thanks to modern caching and concurrency control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses a write-ahead log (WAL) for crash recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "In-Memory and On-Disk Balancing\n",
        "\n",
        "WiredTiger maintains a large cache in memory for frequently accessed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This speeds up reads while still writing changes safely to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transactions Support\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting from MongoDB 4.0, WiredTiger enables multi-document ACID transactions, making MongoDB behave more like traditional SQL databases for critical apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Checkpoints & Crash Recovery\n",
        "\n",
        "WiredTiger periodically writes checkpoints to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "In case of a crash, MongoDB can quickly recover using the journal + checkpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimized for multi-core CPUs and large memory systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Makes MongoDB scale better in modern hardware and cloud environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Real-World Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you’re building an e-commerce app with thousands of users placing orders at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "With MMAPv1 → if one user updates their order, the entire collection might be locked, slowing down everyone else.\n",
        "\n",
        "With WiredTiger → only the specific document being updated is locked, so other users can still browse products, update carts, and place orders simultaneously → smoother user experience."
