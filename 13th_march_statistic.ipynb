        "1. Independence of Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The data collected from each group must be independent of one another. One observation should not influence another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation Example: Measuring the same students’ test scores multiple times but treating them as separate observations. This can lead to misleading significance results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Normality\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed within each group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation Example: If one group’s data is highly skewed (e.g., income data with extreme outliers), the ANOVA results may become unreliable, especially with small sample sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homogeneity of Variances (Equal Variance)\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The variances across the groups should be approximately equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation Example: Comparing test scores where one group has very high variability and another has very low variability. This can increase the risk of Type I error (false positives).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Measurement Scale\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The dependent variable should be measured on an interval or ratio scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation Example: Using ordinal data (such as rankings or Likert-scale responses) instead of continuous numerical data may violate this assumption and affect validity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact of Violations on ANOVA Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation of independence can seriously invalidate results and lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-normality may reduce the accuracy of p-values, especially with small samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unequal variances can inflate or deflate the F-statistic, leading to incorrect hypothesis decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Incorrect measurement scale can make ANOVA inappropriate for the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "ANOVA results are most reliable when assumptions of independence, normality, and homogeneity of variances are met. If these assumptions are violated, alternative methods such as Welch’s ANOVA or non-parametric tests (e.g., Kruskal–Wallis test) should be considered."
