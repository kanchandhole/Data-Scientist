        "Can capture complex class relationships.\n",
        "Often yields higher accuracy due to joint optimization.\n",

        "Odds Ratio:\n",

        "Odds Ratio > 1: Indicates that the odds of the outcome increase with a one-unit increase in the independent variable.\n",
        "Odds Ratio < 1: Indicates that the odds of the outcome decrease with a one-unit increase in the independent variable.\n",
        "Odds Ratio = 1: Indicates that the independent variable has no significant effect on the odds of the outcome.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If the coefficient for age is 0.05, then for every one-year increase in age, the odds of the outcome increase by a factor of e^0.05 = 1.05, or 5%.\n",

        "Coefficients have standard errors that can be used to calculate confidence intervals, providing a range of plausible values for the coefficient.\n",
        "Statistical Significance:\n",
